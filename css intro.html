	<h1>intro to cascading style sheets(css)!!!</h1>
	<h2>subheading 1:</h2>
	<p>this is a paragragh to test how css colours work! i m just gonna write something just to extend this into a not very large paragragh but large enough to look good when the colors are applied to it. i guess this is enough for that. i hope so. by the way this is amazing. i am learning new stuff.</p>
	<h2>subheading 2:</h2>
	<p>rhis another paragragh to test css. i dont even know why i am typing this paragragh instead of copy pasting stuff from internet. maybe because of the fact that like typing using my amazing laptop's keyboard. its just so cool to type like a coderrrr ahhh that agressive typing on the keyboard like a hacker omggg  this is sooo coool at the same time waste of my time and i think at the end of the day it doesnt matter LOL</p>
